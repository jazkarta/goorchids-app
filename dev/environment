# Convenience script for setting up local development environment configuration.
#
# Because we can't publish private keys for various components we use,
# this script references a script that is assumed to be one directory above
# the root of our source control repository. To make use of this script, simply
# place the privately distributed script file in the parent directory of the 
# repo, or set up your environment manually (by adding the keys to your 
# $HOME/.bash_rc, for instance).
#
# Source this file to set up your environment once the private script is in 
# place.
